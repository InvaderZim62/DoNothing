# Do Nothing Machine

I combined two projects into one: three different versions of a do-noting machine, and a Newton's
cradle.  I used a tab-view controller to switch between them.

My cousin had a do-nothing machine with two sliders.  I was facinated with it as a kid, and decided
to make it into an app.  While creating the app, I realized there's no limit to the number of sliders
it can have.
